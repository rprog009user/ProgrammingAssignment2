## This functions allow to store in cache value of inverted matrix
## instead of calculate it each time. Their implementation based on 
## sample functions which cache mean value of vector.

## Put inverted matrix into cache. That cached value can be retrived
## later.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Get inverted matrix. Cache will be used if inverted matrix
## has been already calculated before.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
